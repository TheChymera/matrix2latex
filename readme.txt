Place the folder matrix2latex/ containing at least:
- __init__.py, matrix2latex.py, fixEngineeringNotation.py, error.py and IOString.py
(the rest of the files are optional), somewhere in out PYTHONPATH. 

Your current working directory is always on your PYTHONPATH.

Hint: on unix systems do:
echo $PYTHONPATH
to see a list of locations. Other users: ask google about PYTHONPATH for your operating system.

\title{Documentation for matrix2latex}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
This is the documentation for the matrix2latex package, development can be found here:
\url{http://code.google.com/p/matrix2latex/}

This package provides easy translation of vector/matrices in python or matlab into latex table/matrix code.
The implementation is written in both matlab and python, resulting in some discrepancies in features and usage.
After the introduction we will discuss some
matlab specific usage in chapter \ref{sec:matlab} before showing
all options using the python syntax. Currently the python version is the best maintained.
